# BDE-Performance-Tracker
Managed Ruai Family Hospital's data from 10 branches for 8 months on Google Sheets. Used the QUERY function (a subset of SQL) &amp; formulas to analyze trends in performance, patient acquisition, and commissions. Insights drove decisions to prioritize surgeries with reliable insurance &amp; implement performance plans.

The project leveraged a custom AppSheet mobile app for efficient data collection from Business Development Executives across 10 branches. A Google Form provided a flexible alternative for those with limited storage. Data is parsed and analyzed using powerful QUERY functions and advanced Google Sheets formulas, enabling insightful dashboards tailored for each Business Development Executive.
