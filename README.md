# BDE-Performance-Tracker

The project leveraged a custom AppSheet mobile app for efficient data collection from Business Development Executives across 10 branches. A Google Form provided a flexible alternative for those with limited storage. Data is parsed and analyzed using QUERY functions and advanced Google Sheets formulas, enabling insightful dashboards tailored for each Business Development Executive.
